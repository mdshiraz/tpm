    <p>Practical, scenario-based questions and answers to help you prepare effectively.</p>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        Interviews for Scrum Master roles often go beyond theory—they test your ability to handle real-world
        challenges in Agile environments. Below are some of the most common scenario-based questions (like those
        asked in companies such as Wipro), along with practical answers to help you stand out.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>1. How do you ensure your team remains motivated during long and complex projects?</h3>
      <p>I focus on celebrating small wins, maintaining transparency, and ensuring work is meaningful. Regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and giving autonomy help sustain motivation throughout long projects.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>2. What would you do if your team consistently misses sprint commitments?</h3>
      <p>I would analyze patterns, ensure stories are well-refined and right-sized, and encourage committing based on velocity rather than optimism. The goal is to improve predictability rather than chase stretch goals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>3. How do you handle situations where the Product Owner is unavailable for backlog refinement?</h3>
      <p>I ensure the team has a prioritized backlog prepared in advance, and if the PO is unavailable, I collaborate with stakeholders or use proxy inputs to avoid blocking refinement sessions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>4. How do you deal with team members who resist Agile practices?</h3>
      <p>I listen to their concerns, provide real examples of Agile benefits, and gradually introduce practices that address their pain points. Resistance often reduces once they see results.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>5. What approach do you take when the team delivers quality work but the stakeholders are still unhappy?</h3>
      <p>I bridge the gap by improving communication, involving stakeholders earlier, and ensuring clear definition of “done” and acceptance criteria. Often, expectations alignment solves the disconnect.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>6. How would you coach a team that treats daily stand-ups like status update meetings?</h3>
      <p>I would coach them to focus on collaboration by emphasizing: what was done, what will be done, and what blockers exist. I’d redirect the mindset from reporting to problem-solving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>7. How do you balance delivery pressure from management and protecting the team’s sustainable pace?</h3>
      <p>I advocate for the team’s capacity with management, use velocity trends as evidence, and reinforce the value of sustainable pace to prevent burnout and quality issues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>8. What steps do you take to improve collaboration between developers and testers in the same team?</h3>
      <p>I encourage pairing, cross-functional refinement sessions, and joint ownership of quality. Shared goals and early testing practices (shift-left) improve collaboration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>9. How do you ensure continuous improvement when the team is unwilling to discuss failures in retrospectives?</h3>
      <p>I create a safe, blame-free environment, start with anonymous inputs, and highlight learning opportunities rather than failures. This builds trust and openness gradually.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>10. How do you deal with external dependencies that repeatedly block your sprint progress?</h3>
      <p>I make dependencies visible on the board, escalate recurring blockers, and work with stakeholders to resolve them. Where possible, we aim to reduce dependencies through cross-skilling or architecture changes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>11. What metrics do you track as a Scrum Master, and how do you use them to improve team performance?</h3>
      <p>I track velocity, sprint predictability, cycle time, and defect trends. I use these not for control, but for insights—helping the team reflect, forecast better, and identify bottlenecks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>12. How do you handle a situation where a senior developer dominates sprint planning discussions and overshadows others?</h3>
      <p>I would set ground rules for equal participation, encourage quieter voices, and where needed, have a one-on-one with the senior developer to align on collaborative behavior.</p>
