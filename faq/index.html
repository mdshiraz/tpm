    <h1>Scrum Master Interview FAQs</h1>
    <p>Practical, scenario-based questions and answers to help you prepare effectively.</p>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        Scrum Master interviews often test your ability to handle <strong>real-world Agile challenges</strong> rather than just theory. 
        Below are some of the most common <strong>scenario-based interview questions</strong> (often asked in companies like Wipro, Infosys, and TCS), 
        with practical answers to help you stand out.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 1 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>1. How do you ensure your team remains motivated during long and complex projects?</h3>
      <p>I focus on celebrating small wins, maintaining transparency, and ensuring work is meaningful. Regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and giving autonomy help sustain motivation throughout long projects.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 2 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>2. What would you do if your team consistently misses sprint commitments?</h3>
      <p>I would analyze patterns, ensure stories are well-refined and right-sized, and encourage committing based on velocity rather than optimism. The goal is to improve predictability rather than chase stretch goals.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 3 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>3. How do you handle conflicts between Product Owner and Development Team?</h3>
      <p>I act as a neutral facilitator, ensuring both sides are heard. I focus discussions on customer value, transparency, and data to reach alignment instead of personal opinions.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 4 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>4. What steps do you take when priorities change mid-sprint?</h3>
      <p>I protect the sprint goal and team focus. If changes are critical, I collaborate with the Product Owner to decide whether to stop the sprint and replan, ensuring transparency with stakeholders.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 5 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>5. How do you support a new team that struggles with Agile adoption?</h3>
      <p>I start with education and coaching, introducing Agile practices gradually. I focus on creating psychological safety so team members feel comfortable experimenting and learning.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 6 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>6. How do you deal with a dominant team member who overshadows others?</h3>
      <p>I use facilitation techniques to ensure equal participation, like round-robin discussions. Privately, I coach the dominant member to recognize the importance of balanced collaboration.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 7 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>7. How do you ensure continuous improvement in your team?</h3>
      <p>I make retrospectives actionable, track improvements, and celebrate progress. I also use data (like lead time, velocity trends) to drive discussions and measure impact.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 8 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>8. How do you manage dependencies in a scaled environment?</h3>
      <p>I promote early identification of dependencies during backlog refinement, use visual tools like dependency boards, and coordinate with other Scrum Masters to align delivery plans.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 9 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>9. How do you handle stakeholders pushing for unrealistic deadlines?</h3>
      <p>I use transparency: show velocity, backlog, and delivery forecasts. I negotiate scope instead of time, ensuring we deliver value without burning out the team.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 10 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>10. How do you handle a situation where team members lack required skills?</h3>
      <p>I encourage pair programming, knowledge sharing, and targeted upskilling. I also bring in external support if needed while ensuring long-term capability building within the team.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 11 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>11. How do you measure success as a Scrum Master?</h3>
      <p>I measure success by the team’s ability to deliver predictably, improve continuously, collaborate effectively, and create customer value. My role is successful when the team is self-organizing.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 12 -->
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>12. How do you keep remote/distributed teams engaged?</h3>
      <p>I use engaging online collaboration tools, keep ceremonies interactive, encourage video-on for better connection, and focus on building trust and informal interactions beyond work.</p>
