      <details>
        <summary><span class="q-num">1.</span>How do you ensure your team remains motivated during long and complex projects?</summary>
        <div class="a">
          I keep motivation high by celebrating small wins, maintaining visible progress, and linking daily work to the product vision. We protect a sustainable pace, recognize contributions, and give autonomy in how goals are met.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="q-num">2.</span>What would you do if your team consistently misses sprint commitments?</summary>
        <div class="a">
          Missing commitments is feedback, not failure. We break work smaller, plan from historical velocity, and add buffer for unknowns. Commitments become realistic forecasts, not stretch goals—improving predictability and trust.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="q-num">3.</span>How do you handle situations where the Product Owner is unavailable for backlog refinement?</summary>
        <div class="a">
          Reinforce the PO’s critical role and secure their time. If unavailable, continue with documented assumptions and proxy stakeholders (BA/SME), then validate decisions with the PO to prevent misalignment.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="q-num">4.</span>How do you deal with team members who resist Agile practices?</summary>
        <div class="a">
          Listen first. Explain the “why,” then run small experiments that show concrete benefits—faster feedback, less rework. Use coaching and evidence to let outcomes reduce resistance.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="q-num">5.</span>The team delivers quality work, but stakeholders are unhappy—what do you do?</summary>
        <div class="a">
          Uncover unmet expectations and improve transparency. Align on Definition of Done and acceptance criteria, increase feedback via demos, and reset priorities together to close the expectations gap.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="q-num">6.</span>How would you coach a team that treats daily stand-ups like status updates?</summary>
        <div class="a">
          Reframe stand-ups as coordination, not reporting: what was done, what’s next, and blockers. Encourage peer-to-peer updates, keep it time-boxed, and facilitate actively to keep it collaborative.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="q-num">7.</span>How do you balance delivery pressure from management with a sustainable pace?</summary>
        <div class="a">
          Use data (velocity, cycle time, defect trends) to show the cost of overloading. Negotiate scope, sequence, or timelines instead of overtime. Sustainable delivery consistently beats heroics.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="q-num">8.</span>What steps improve collaboration between developers and testers?</summary>

        <summary><span class="q-num">9.</span>How do you ensure continuous improvement when the team avoids discussing failures?</summary>
        <div class="a">
          Build psychological safety. Start with wins, allow anonymous input, and frame topics as opportunities. Use facilitation formats that lower risk and run small, reversible experiments.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="q-num">10.</span>How do you handle external dependencies that block sprint progress?</summary>

      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="q-num">11.</span>What metrics do you track as a Scrum Master, and how do you use them?</summary>
        <div class="a">
