      <h1>Scrum Master FAQs</h1>
      <p>Concise, scenario-based answers to the common questions interviewers and teams ask most often.</p>
    </header>

    <div class="intro">
      These FAQs are taken from a real interview-style list and rewritten as short, practical answers you can publish on your site or use when preparing for Scrum Master interviews.
    </div>

    <section class="faqs" aria-label="Frequently asked Scrum Master questions">

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">1.</span> How do you ensure your team remains motivated during long and complex projects?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Celebrate small wins, keep progress visible, and connect day-to-day work to the product vision. Protect a sustainable pace, recognize contributions publicly, and give the team autonomy over how they deliver.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">2.</span> What would you do if your team consistently misses sprint commitments?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Treat missed commitments as feedback. Break stories into smaller pieces, plan from historical velocity, add buffer for unknowns, surface blockers early, and use retros to identify root causes. Commit to realistic forecasts rather than stretch goals.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">3.</span> How do you handle situations where the Product Owner is unavailable for backlog refinement?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Reinforce the PO's role and schedule regular refinement time. If the PO is unavailable, work with proxy stakeholders (BA/SME), document assumptions, and validate decisions with the PO as soon as possible to avoid rework.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">4.</span> How do you deal with team members who resist Agile practices?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Listen to their concerns, explain the "why", and run small experiments that demonstrate benefits (faster feedback, reduced rework). Use coaching, evidence, and invite them to design improvements so they feel ownership.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">5.</span> What approach do you take when the team delivers quality work but the stakeholders are still unhappy?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Explore the gap between delivery and expectations—clarify acceptance criteria and Definition of Done, increase demo cadence, and align priorities with stakeholders to ensure work delivers expected value.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">6.</span> How would you coach a team that treats daily stand-ups like status update meetings?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Reframe the stand-up as a coordination tool: focus on what was done, what will be done, and blockers. Encourage peer-to-peer problem solving, keep it timeboxed, and model facilitation that drives collaboration rather than reporting.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">7.</span> How do you balance between delivery pressure from management and protecting the team's sustainable pace?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Use data (velocity, cycle time, defect trends) to show long-term cost of overload. Negotiate scope or timelines instead of overtime, propose MVP approaches, and advocate for predictable delivery to build stakeholder trust.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">8.</span> What steps do you take to improve collaboration between developers and testers in the same team?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Involve testers early in refinement, encourage pairing and swarming, share ownership of quality, and invest in test automation and practices like BDD to remove handoffs and reduce rework.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">9.</span> How do you ensure continuous improvement when the team is unwilling to discuss failures in retrospectives?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Build psychological safety first: start with wins, allow anonymous inputs, use structured retrospective formats that lower risk, and run small, reversible experiments to rebuild trust and openness.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">10.</span> How do you deal with external dependencies that repeatedly block your sprint progress?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Make dependencies visible, document SLA/lead times, escalate chronic blockers, and work to reduce dependency risk through cross-skilling, better sequencing, or architectural changes. Adjust sprint commitments when dependencies exist.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">11.</span> What metrics do you track as a Scrum Master, and how do you use them to improve team performance?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          I track velocity, sprint predictability (% committed vs delivered), cycle time/lead time, WIP, and defect trends. Use metrics to spot bottlenecks and guide improvement conversations—not to grade individuals.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="qnum">12.</span> How do you handle a situation where a senior developer dominates sprint planning discussions and overshadows others?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Facilitate balanced participation (round-robin, silent brainstorming), invite quieter voices, and coach the senior privately on inclusive behavior. Set ground rules so planning benefits from diverse perspectives.
        </div>
